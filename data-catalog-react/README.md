# Data Catalog React Example

This directory contains a small React application showcasing a data catalog UI. It uses Vite for development and Tailwind CSS for styling. The production build outputs to the `build` directory so it works with the Vercel static builder.

## Setup

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open the printed local URL (usually `http://localhost:5173`).
