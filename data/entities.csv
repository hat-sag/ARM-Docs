Reservation,Future planned occupancy,Resident + Unit + Date,No,ARM.tblReservation,,Event,,,,"Revenue, Occupancy",Represents future resident commitment prior to move-in.,Unioned into move-in tracking in reports.,Pending move-in status.,Inferred join behavior; may need status logic.
Scheduled Move-Out,Future scheduled move-out,Resident + Date + Community,Yes,ARM.tblMoveOutSchedule,,Event,,,,"Revenue, Occupancy",Flags future/planned departures.,Unioned into move-out logic.,Used for forecasting exits.,May require `IsAutoApply` flag review.
Inquiry Referral,The referral associated with customer inquiries.,InquiryID + CustomerID,Yes,ARM.tblInquiryReferral,InsightSales.factInquiryByReferral,Event,"Referral category, contact, corporation",CreateDT,,Occupancy,Links inquiries to referral categories/sources.,Requires luReferralCategoryType.,Pulls from Inquiry and Referral tables.,More complex in Business Data than in Insight.
Lease,Contractual stay period,1 per LeaseID,No,ARM.tblLease,InsightResident.factLeaseSegment,Status,,StartDT and EndDT,,Not explicitly used,Tracks contractual stay period.,Possible use in occupancy start logic.,Exists in InsightResident.factLeaseSegment.,Unclear usage; may be unused currently.
Resident Payor,Payor relationship over time,Resident + Lease + Entry + Unit,No,ARM.tblResidentPayor,InsightResident.factResidentRoom,Status,Payor Type (→ luPayor),EffectiveDT,,"Revenue, Occupancy, Rate Increase","Tracks payor type over time (e.g., Medicaid, Private).",Join to lookup table required for payor description.,"Important for segmentation, especially point-in-time.",Time-dependent joins needed for accuracy.
Occupancy Budget,Target occupancy for a care type in a community,Community + Care Type + Month,Yes ,ARM.lnkCommunityToOccupancyBudget,,Status,Care type,Month start,"Budgetted occupancy, capacity. Unit and resident",Occupancy,Represents target occupancy and capacity by care type.,CareType and Community joins.,Usually pivoted structure.,Complex table; likely needs ETL work.
Community,A property/building,1 per CommunityID,No,ARM.tblCommunity,InsightMaster.mstrCommunity,Dimension,"Region, State, Owner, Brand, Division, Community Name",Open date,"Current occupancy, capacity","Revenue, Occupancy, Rate Increase","Contextual dimension (region, division, etc.).",Join via %CommunityKey. Matches to CMT.,Report inclusion flag comes from IsReportFlg.,Insight naming differences; check SPROC logic.
